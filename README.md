MQ-3 Gas Sensor: VCC -> 5V
                 A0 -> A0
                 D0 -> D15
                 GND -> GND
     !please note that the MQ-3 has a preheat time of 24H, so it may be inaccurate!
 
 Sparfun Sound Detector: VCC -> 3.3V
                         Enveloppe -> D16
                         GND -> GND
                         I didn't connect the Gate pin and Audio pin for this project.
                         
 RGB Alcohol (common kathode): GND -> GND
                               Red -> D2
                               Green -> D3
                               Blue -> D4
                               
RGB Sound (common kathode):   GND -> GND
